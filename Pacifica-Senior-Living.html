                        <p><br>The dog therapy event held at Pacifica Senior Living was another collaboration with Alliance of Therapy Dogs. Four beautiful dogs were brought to this event to help improve the emotional state of seniors in the memory care
                            unit at Pacifica Senior Living. The seniors enjoyed the various breeds of dogs that were brought and reminisced about their own experiences with dogs. One such instance was when a person with dementia recalled that they owned
                            up to 6 dogs at one time and bred two generations of dogs. The dogs, just like music, served as a gateway into the past memories of the seniors. Finding this effective vector of communication is imperative in executing a successful
                            therapeutic event. This is because accessing memories in seniors with dementia is comparable to jumpstarting a car. The dogs act as the spark of energy which allows seniors to re-access lost memories. Even seniors who have
                            had a life-long fear of dogs stepped out of their comfort zones and started petting them. Because bringing the dogs elicited such positive reactions out of the seniors who participated, ReMind is working with Alliance of Therapy
                            Dogs to bring more of these events to senior homes across California. <br><br></p>
