                        <p><br> A second successful music therapy event was held in On Lok Lifeways, a senior residential community in San Jose. Music therapists Taffy Su and Sylvester Sroka joined us again in providing a spectacular afternoon music therapy
                            session for seniors. <br> This event was a cultural mixing pot of music which allowed seniors to have a fresh experience. Ms. Su expertly used her knowledge of different cultural music to provide seniors with a unique perspective
                            on music therapy. The percussion and drums are drawn from African roots while the songs themselves were drawn from American, Asian, and Latin American inspirations. A combination of these music types appealed to the varied
                            cultural demographic of the seniors at the event. Moreover, it exposed new exciting forms of music to seniors who might not have otherwise heard them.<br> The value of multicultural music is centered around the fact that seniors
                            felt more connected than ever to the music they were singing and playing. It aligned with their cultural identity, while also opening the gateway into their memories associated with their culture. <br> Despite the vast background
                            of cultures, music was the common unifying medium which allowed the seniors to interact with not only ReMind members, but also other fellow seniors. It allowed them to become more connected with themselves as well as the people
                            around them, greatly improving their emotional and mental health. The qualitative benefits of music therapy were present and the ethnographic integration of different cultures greatly compounded its effects. <br> The ReMind
                            team was able to drum, sing, and co-lead the session with Ms. Su and Mr. Sroka. It opened a new perspective in the teamâ€™s eyes because this was a unique event which nobody on the team had ever experienced before. It provided
                            new insights for the team on how to make seniors feel more empowered and connected when facing dementia. <br> Once again, ReMind would like to thank the Music for Therapy team for partnering up with us to make this event amazing.
