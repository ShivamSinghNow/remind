                        <p>On August 24, 2019, ReMind was able to partner up with Brookdale Senior Living of North Fremont to deliver our successful Music for Memories Concert. This event has become widely popular because of its ability to bring people from
                            different musical backgrounds together. Our performers expanded upon our base set of songs in order to provide a truly enriching experience for the listeners. The seniors expressed heavy interest in songs like "You Are My Sunshine"
                            and "Yellow Submarine." Many of them sung along for popular American folk songs like "This Land is Your Land." <br></p>
                        <p>Through our experiences with this event, music seems to be a medium of connection and unification. Musically created bonds were present between the caregivers and seniors, seniors and their families, and even seniors with the student
                            performers. Some families were present at the event and there was a high level of engagement between the seniors and their families. They sang along for songs they knew and even reminisced about the past and talked about music
                            they enjoyed from the performance. Additionally, the performers and the seniors were able to have meaningful conversations and interactions. Pranav Ramesh recalls speaking with one lady about her favorite types of music while
                            growing up and how much she loves the work which ReMind is doing. This is a stark contrast when compared to the beginning of the event, where she was quiet and sedentary. <br></p>
