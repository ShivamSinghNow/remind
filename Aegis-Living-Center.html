                        <p><br>Pet Therapy is a new and upcoming way of treating patients who have dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. It is a creative approach involving the use of certified pets such as dogs to come and interact with seniors.
                            On March 23, ReMind partnered up with the national organization, Alliance of Therapy Dogs, to host and facilitate an event at Aegis Living Assisted Living and Memory Care in Fremont, CA. After observing interactions between
                            the seniors and therapy dogs, a brief discussion was held between the handlers and ReMind members in order to get a broader insight into how the entire process worked. As soon as the residents saw the dogs wagging their tails
                            and roaming around the tables in the activity room, there was a noticeable change in the atmosphere of the senior home. The residents’ moods were uplifted as they laughed, hugged the pets, and chatted brightly with the pet
                            handlers. After interacting with dogs, many seniors became significantly more responsive and started to open up to the team about memories about their own dogs. Patients who have late-stage Alzheimer’s also benefited from the
                            pet therapy because they were able to recall past events and carry out full conversations with ReMind members. Dr. Pat Wheeler, an experienced therapy dog owner, has been assisting people through pet therapy for over a decade
                            now. As a representative of the organization Alliance of Therapy Dogs, she was able to bring together an experienced group of therapy dog handlers. During our conversation with them, we were surprised at the immense passion
                            and enthusiasm for pet therapy that they all displayed. Dr. Wheeler and the other pet handlers were extremely patient with our questions and were more than happy to share their experiences so we could better understand the
                            impact that pet therapy has. They described pet therapy as an opportunity to truly infuse instant joy into the lives of seniors living with dementia and recalled past experiences, where patients who were fully in an unresponsive
                            state, yet miraculously opened up to caregivers. They describe it as “pure magic.” The benefits of pet therapy are not limited to dementia treatment. There have been many cross-translational benefits such as decreasing symptoms
                            of depression and anxiety, reduce fatigue, and are correlated with the decrease of numerous other health problems. However, some of the largest challenges which pet therapy faces are its scalability and backing by concrete
                            evidence. All of the results are purely based on reactions, yet researchers are yet to find the exact scientific workings behind the benefits of pet therapy. Additionally, in order to increase its prominence, the implementation
                            model is something that needs to be perfect in order to allow the widespread use of pet therapy. ReMind is working as a partner of the California division of Alliance of Therapy Dogs to increase its prominence in caregiving
                            centers throughout California.<br><br></p>
