                        <p><br>ReMindâ€™s first event with Sunrise Senior Living in San Ramon was a huge success. Performers Pranav Ramesh and Srikar Bhuvan collaborated to deliver a truly special event for the seniors at this location. This concert started
                            off with a large group discussion with seniors about how much music has played a role in their lives. The responses varied from being extremely impactful to being a small part of their lives. However, the amount of initial
                            excitement that was spurred from this conversation was extremely prominent. One of the most effective techniques in assimilating the seniors with the performers was getting to know the performers and audience on a deeply personal
                            level. This high amount of interactivity between the audience and singers resulted in greater engagement during the performance. As soon as the singing started, 10 to 15 seniors immediately started singing along. The number
                            of people who were able to retain complex lyrics in the music was astounding. This event truly speaks to the effectiveness of engaged music concerts. One of the biggest breakthroughs that the ReMind team has discovered is that
                            passively interacting with the audience yields mediocre results as the full potential of music is not exercised. However, the 5-minute conversation done prior to the hour-long performance made the experience very memorable
                            for the audience. ReMind will continue to implement these interactive speaking portions in music events in the future. Make sure to look at the ReMind calendar for future events and volunteering opportunities. <br><br></p>
