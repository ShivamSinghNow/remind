                        <p>It is our pleasure to announce that ReMind was able to kick off a new series of event offerings called "Music for Memories" concerts. These concerts provide a new form of teen-to-elder interaction as well as explore the benefits
                            of music on dementia. Our team does research to find out some of the most popular songs in the era of seniors' childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Students then learn, and perform these songs to a group of seniors at a caregiving
                            home. This provides an unparalleled source of personal interaction between teens and seniors while also uplifting a senior's emotional and mental well being. <br> ReMind jump-started this new event series at Pacifica Senior
                            Living in Union City. Popular songs from the Beatles, Dean Martin, and Frank Sinatra were all sung while also incorporating some popular American Folk Songs. One key element which we noticed among the seniors was that even
                            without knowing the songs, they still enjoyed the performances and it enlivened many of them. Before the performance began, a majority of them were sedentary and not talking. However, after 5 minutes into the performance, many
                            senior residents started clapping humming and moving to the beat of the song. ReMind was also able to put on a bonus concert for residents in who lived in Assisted Living. The same personal interactions and happiness while
                            listening to music were still present. This demonstrates how music, no matter what kind, can be used as an effective vector of treatment for dementia. The basis of the benefits of music on dementia are mostly anecdotal, but
                            this shouldn't stop memory care homes and caregivers from accepting the benefits that music has to offer. Be on the lookout for more Music for Memories Concert blog posts coming soon!<br></p>
