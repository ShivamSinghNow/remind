                        <p><br>The service event for Oak Creek’s Alzheimers and Dementia care was a success. A majority of the senior citizens were able to enjoy the presence of two precious dogs: Nash and Charlie. Upon entering the center with the service
                            dogs from Alliance Of Therapy Dogs, we could immediately see the seniors light up with surprise. They were constantly trying to pet the dogs despite having physical limitations, prompting the volunteers and owners to make quick
                            rotations so everyone would have an opportunity. Some of the senior citizens were asking many questions, while others would just quietly pet the dogs. Nash’s owner then proceeded to share what she thought was one of the most
                            rewarding experiences while helping those with Alzheimers. She stated that through pet therapy, some people suffering from memory issues (neurodegenerative disease) continuously remembered and smiled at her service dog the
                            following visits.When interviewing the service pet owners, we found out that they had been working with Alliance of Therapy Dogs for years to provide dog therapy events for seniors with dementia. Through Alliance of Therapy
                            Dogs, the program which trains service dogs, ordinary dogs could eventually make a big impact on peoples’ lives. Our partner provides the testing, certification, registration, support, and insurance for members that volunteer
                            with dogs to visit hospitals, special needs centers, and other facilities. Nash’s owner claimed that her favorite part of bringing her dog to events is meeting new people and seeing the positive impact dog therapy has on individuals.
                            Some events these particular service dogs have participated in include reading to kindergarten kids and helping those in physical and mental rehabilitation. By working with Alliance of Therapy Dogs, we were able to create a
                            lasting experience for the senior citizens and draw attention to the importance of pet therapy. <br><br></p>
