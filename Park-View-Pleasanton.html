                        <p>ReMind members Srikar Bhuvan and Pranav Ramesh were able to revisit the Palo Alto Area and hold a music concert for seniors living at The Parkview. This event, in particular, was special as almost 25 seniors were present at the
                            event. The performers sang a wide variety of American classics including “Yellow Submarine” by the Beatles and “Memories are Made of This” by Dean Martin. All of the songs which were sung received very positive responses from
                            the audience. Although the audience was shy to sing along at first, within 5 minutes every member of the audience was singing their heart out to “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” a quintessential American classic. ReMind successfully
                            utilized the same event model which was first used at a music concert at Sunrise Senior Living in San Ramon. ReMind’s breakthrough in structuring interactive music concerts have been instrumental in increasing senior satisfaction
                            during and after events. The vast majority of seniors who attended the concert personally thanked the singers and requested that they come back for more performances. ReMind’s partnership with The Parkview Memory Care unit
                            has been positively impactful on the residents. Be sure to look at the ReMind calendar to see future events and volunteering opportunities. <br><br></p>
